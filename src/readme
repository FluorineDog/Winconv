
#Code Description: This code is a sample code used for convolution computation based on winograd algorithm. It is paralleled with OpenMP and written in C/C++. It will compute 18 convolution layers and here are more information about code modification below.
-   "C_array, IH_array, IW_array, K_array, Batch_array" are convolution parameters, CANN’t be modified;

#Usage:
-	How to compiler:  ./build.sh
-	How to run: “./test 0”  is for performance and “ ./test 1”  is for result validation. 

#Optimization Direction:
-	SIMD  and Memory Access Optimization by intrinsic if needed
-	Winograd Algorithm Modification，such as F(3,3) 
-	SGEMM performance improvement
-	Pipeline Optimization between data transform and SGEMM computing
